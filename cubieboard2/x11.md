# Installing fbturbo.

Before we can install fbturbo and its dependencies using the overlay, we have
to add the following lines to /etc/portage/package.keywords in order to unblock
the packages:

```
x11-libs/libdri2 ~arm
x11-drivers/xf86-video-fbturbo ~arm
```

Then we can install the package by running:

```
emerge -av xf86-video-fbturbo
```

# Configuring X.

Now we have to tell X to use fbturbo, this can be done by editing
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-fbturbo.conf, the following is an example set-up for a
single display that is connected via HDMI:

```
Section "ServerFlags"
	Option		"BlankTime" "0"
	Option		"StandbyTime" "0"
	Option		"SuspendTime" "0"
	Option		"OffTime" "0"
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"/dev/fb0"
	Driver		"fbturbo"
	Option		"fbdev" "/dev/fb0"
	Option		"SwapBuffersWait" "true"
	Option		"AccelMethod" "G2D"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"HDMI-0"
	Device		"/dev/fb0"
	Monitor		"LG"
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"Default Layout"
	Screen		0 "HDMI-0" 0 0
EndSection
```

# Configuring multi-head X.

With the Allwinner A10, A13 and A20 SoCs, X can also be set up to use two
displays simultaneously, the following is an example set-up for two identical
displays with a resolution of 1920x1080 that are being put next to each other,
where one is connected via HDMI, and the other via VGA:

```
Section "ServerFlags"
	Option		"BlankTime" "0"
	Option		"StandbyTime" "0"
	Option		"SuspendTime" "0"
	Option		"OffTime" "0"
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"/dev/fb0"
	Driver		"fbturbo"
	Option		"fbdev" "/dev/fb0"
	Option		"SwapBuffersWait" "true"
	Option		"AccelMethod" "G2D"
EndSection

Section "Device"
	Identifier	"/dev/fb1"
	Driver		"fbturbo"
	Option		"fbdev" "/dev/fb1"
	Option		"SwapBuffersWait" "true"
	Option		"AccelMethod" "G2D"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"VGA-0"
	Device		"/dev/fb0"
	Monitor		"LG"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
	Identifier	"HDMI-0"
	Device		"/dev/fb1"
	Monitor		"LG"
EndSection

Section "ServerLayout"
	Identifier	"Default Layout"
	Screen		0 "VGA-0" 0 0
	Screen		1 "HDMI-0" 1920 0
EndSection
```
