# Installing fbturbo.

Before we can install fbturbo and its dependencies using the overlay, we have
to add the following lines to /etc/portage/package.keywords in order to unblock
the packages:

```
x11-libs/libdri2 ~arm
x11-drivers/xf86-video-fbturbo ~arm
```

Then we can install the package by running:

```
emerge -av xf86-video-fbturbo
```

# Configuring X to use fbturbo.

Now we have to tell X to use fbturbo, this can be done by adding the following
lines to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-fbturbo.conf:

```
Section "Device"
	Identifier	"Allwinner A10/A13 FBDEV"
	Driver		"fbturbo"
	Option		"fbdev" "/dev/fb0"
	Option		"SwapBuffersWait" "true"
	Option		"AccelMethod" "G2D"
EndSection
```

These settings have been fine-tuned for the Cubieboard.

# Disabling DPMS.

With some monitors there may be a bug that when they can get turned off via the
use of DPMS, the Cubieboard won't be able to turn them on again. To prevent that
from happening you can run the following every time you start up X11, or add it
to your .xinitrc:

```
xset -dpms
```
